  <div class="entry-content"><p>The guys from <a href="http://divmod.com">Divmod</a> were here at PyCon and today
the gave a little talk about their service.</p>

<p>The basic functionality of their site is to provide a way to collect
your email, rss, calendars, etc. into one place and they&#8217;ll catalog it
for easy searching and relating the information together.</p>

<p>They also provide VoIP service and can keep a log of your calls which is
tied into the same address book information from your email, etc.
Apparently they&#8217;ll soon be able to let you specify rules about different
people trying to contact you, so that email or calls from certain people
are important and always go through, or others can get directed to voice
mail. This can even be set up to be on a schedule so that people could
only get in contact with you during business hours, or other similar
rules.</p>

<p>The thing that I found most interesting is that they&#8217;re working on
determining information about references to dates for scheduling
appointments. They claim that they&#8217;ll be able to pick up on phrases like
&#8220;next Thursday&#8221; and determine prompt you if you want to create an
appointment about the meeting that you were discussing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today at <a href="http://pycon.org/dc2005/">PyCon</a> I went to the talk on the
<a href="http://roundup.sf.net/">Roundup Issue Tracker</a> to see what I could
learn from them for use in <a href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac">Trac</a>.</p>

<p>One thing that I realized would be good is to add a QuickStart document
for getting the built-in tracd up and running with minimal
configuration. As the Trac user base is growing, the installation
questions are growing. I think that there are still going to be a lot of
people who want to use Trac via Apache. However, I think that if people
can get tracd up and running quickly there will be less people that get
stuck with nothing running. This should give them a chance to play with
Trac a bit, rather than getting hung up on the Apache config right at
the beginning and asking a bunch of questions that they&#8217;d figure out on
their own in a minute if they had a running Trac server.</p>

<p>The feature of Roundup that seemed interesting is their use of email for
issue reporting and discussion. This has been requested in Trac several
times, but I haven&#8217;t yet seen a good proposal on the format these emails
should have. I liked that Roundup would use the CC list on emails to add
new people to the so-called &#8220;nosy&#8221; list that is notified of changes.</p>

<p>Roundup also supports <a href="http://lists.edgewall.com/archive/trac/2004-December/001371.html">hook scripts</a>
similar to the idea I proposed on the Trac mailing list. I think that
this would be a nice way to provide extension points for customizing the
Trac event model.</p>

<p>During the talk I had decided I wasn&#8217;t going to bring up Trac, since I
didn&#8217;t really want to come across as rude by promoting a competing
application. However, during the Q&amp;A time following the talk someone
asked about Subversion integration. Richard (Rick?) indicated that he
thought you could write some shell scripts, etc. to tie the two
together, but didn&#8217;t have a really good answer. So, of course at that
point I had to put in a little plug for Trac. Some of the Mac people
were taking notes on
<a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> and put the site
URL up on there, so I&#8217;m hoping some people will check it out.</p>

<p>Best quote of the conference:</p>

<blockquote><p>When all you have is a hammer screws are stupid</p></blockquote>

<time datetime="2004-05-09T04:00:00Z" pubdate  data-updated="true" >May 9<span>th</span>, 2004</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided to try writing an entire post in
<a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/">Dasher</a> just to see how
easy it was to use. Dasher is an alternative way to enter text on the
computer. It is mainly geared towards use in small devices where a
keyboard would take too much space, or for people with a disability
which prevents them from using a keyboard. The Dasher program included
with Gnome 2.6 consists of a text box at the top showing what you have
typed and the Dasher input area at the bottom. Dasher is controlled
simply by moving the mouse cursor. Letters appear on the right side of
the screen in colored boxes. These boxes are scaled in proportion to the
how likely you are to choose them.</p>

<p>Typing in Dasher feels a bit like playing a video game. As you move the
mouse, you sort of steer towards the letters you want to type. The boxes
containing the letters grow as you move towards them and boxes for
following letters appear inside the existing ones. Since Dasher uses a
language model to predict the probability of each subsequent letter, the
word you intend to type begins to appear on the right side of the
screen. This feature seems to work quite well since it doesn&#8217;t just look
for any word that begins with the letters you have typed,but it also
considers the context of the sentence you are writing. Dasher even seems
to learn as you type. For example, the first time I wrote the word
&#8220;Dasher&#8221; it took a little tricky maneuvering, but the subsequent times
it became much easier to type.</p>

<p>Dasher even helps you spell words since the letters for the correct
spelling will appear much larger. However, I don&#8217;t knowhow quickly
Dasher would learn an incorrect spelling that would throw it off in the
future. Once you get used to the navigation in Dasher it feels quite
natural and you can turn up the speed it moves at to type at a quite
reasonable pace.</p>

<p>Of course, Dasher is not without problems. The most frustrating one is
that it will freeze up periodically on my computer. I have an Athlon XP
2000+, so it&#8217;s much faster than the handheld systems the software is
supposed to be usable on. I&#8217;ll have to look into this to see what&#8217;s
going on.</p>

<p>Also, it would be useful to have Dasher operate in a way that it could
be used to input text directly into any program. Users can copy text
from Dasher into another program, but if text could be input directly
into a word processor the user would be able to take advantage of other
features such as the real-time spell checking.</p>

<p>I should also note that Dasher includes training text for a variety of
languages, so users that don&#8217;t speak English will be able to take full
advantage of the software right away without taking time to train it
themselves. I may try training it on Python, or HTML to see how easily
it adapts. Although I had never written anything in Dasher before
writing this post, I can already type fairly fast in it, but it would
probably be quite difficult to code in it since my thoughts don&#8217;t really
tend to flow as linearly when I&#8217;m programming and Dasher isn&#8217;t
particularly well suited towards jumping around and editing text.
However, I will admit that it was much more fun writing this post in
Dasher than it would be typing it out normally. It feels kind of like
the computer is reading your mind when you can see the words you were
thinking of appear on the screen before you even begin to enter them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Please, I&#8217;m begging you, get Sen. Orrin Hatch out of office as soon as
possible. This man is completely out of touch with reality. He&#8217;s already
introduced a bill that exempts the music industry for antitrust suits so
that they can dictate royalties on music downloads without fear of
repercussions and now he&#8217;s trying to pile more crap on this bill.</p>

<p>Hatch wants to strengthen the <a href="http://hatch.senate.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressReleases.Detail&amp;PressRelease_id=946&amp;Month=11&amp;Year=2003">EnFORCE Act</a>
to give the record companies more power to dictate royalties on
&#8220;innovative forms of physical phonorecords, like enhanced compact disks
and DVD audio disks&#8221;. Specifically they want to start releasing
double-sided CDs where one side is a normal audio CD and the other side
is an SACD or DVD-audio. And guess what? They want to charge separate
royalties for each format on the disc. So, either the distributers have
to be willing to take a cut in their profit margin to sell these
products, or they&#8217;ll have to charge you as much for the dual-format
version as you would pay to buy the two versions separately.</p>

<p>Now I understand that the record labels want to make as much money as
they can get, but why is the government <em>promoting</em> monopolistic
practices? You would think that with all the uproar over the corporate
corruption cases and the Microsoft antitrust suits that people would
take notice of the fact that we have senators pushing through
legislation that &#8220;will expand an existing antitrust exemption.&#8221;
Capitalism thrives on competition. Once you eliminate the competition it
hurts consumers.</p>

<p>On a weird note this quote is also in Hatch&#8217;s statement (emphasis
added):</p>

<blockquote><p>The bill also requires the Department of Justice to report to Congress
detailed information about the scope of its efforts to investigate and
prosecute <em>crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors or
intellectual property.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Zuh?!?!?</strong> I mean how do you sexually exploit intellectual property?
Ok, that was dumb. Honestly though, this is the only time he talks about
sexual exploitation of minors so it seems fairly blatant that it was
just thrown in as a way to make the bill more palatable. How can you
oppose a bill that&#8217;s trying to strengthen prosecution of crimes
involving the sexual exploitation of minors?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>The notice clearly states that Comcast has been asked by the copyright
owner to tell the individual of their actions and demand that the
downloaded file(s) be immediately removed. In addition, the individual

<p>Well, <a href="http://aorula.com/2004_05_01_archive.php#108356004494418547">this guy</a>
misread the <a href="http://aorula.com/images/20040503/Comcast_Doc.jpg">letter</a>,

without reading it and, as often happens, the person who actually took
the time to read the letter and pointed out the mistake didn&#8217;t get their
post in until way down in the comments.</p>

<p>Of course, I made the same mistake when I first got a similar letter
(s/Comcast/Cox/g; s/MGM/Warner/g; s/Walking Tall/Matchstick Men/g) a
couple months ago. No, you&#8217;re not forced to write an apology. The
confusing section about writing a response only applies if they made a
mistake and the file that you are sharing isn&#8217;t really the movie they
think it is. You can write them and let them know that they made a
mistake so that you can continue sharing the file.</p>

<p>I just modded down the moron who said <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=106196&amp;amp;cid=9040512">&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember anything about being guilty until proven innocent.&#8221;</a>
Someone did point out the fallacy in this guy&#8217;s claim, but this troll
still got modded +5 Insightful. <strong>Comcast != US court</strong> they can
terminate your service if they feel like it. If Comcast had actually
forced a written apology, or tried to impose a fine or something this
might be a reasonable response.</p>

<p>Now, some may claim that Comcast/Cox/etc. shouldn&#8217;t just go along with
the MPAA like this. Of course if they didn&#8217;t, then the MPAA would be
forced to file lawsuits and subpoena the ISP for the information
anyways. As it is, you get off with a warning and they don&#8217;t piss off
everyone like the RIAA did. I guess the ISPs don&#8217;t have to go through
the legal hassle either. So, it&#8217;s not such a bad idea if you ask me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://wired.com">Wired</a>&#8217;s article
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,63264,00.html">Will RSS Readers Clog the Web?</a>
starts off with some interesting points about the bandwidth problems with
aggregators, but I don&#8217;t really agree with some of their conclusions.</p>

<p>Like stated in the article, it&#8217;s definitely important for aggregators to
support time-stamp checking to make sure they don&#8217;t keep grabbing the
same feed over and over. Of course the flip-side is it&#8217;s also important
for servers to be able to provide this information. Pyblosxom (which
powers this blog) doesn&#8217;t seem to have this ability.</p>

<p>One of my problems with the article is that they don&#8217;t mention that
grabbing an RSS feed is most likely going to consume less bandwidth than
loading the page in a browser.</p>

<blockquote><p>Whereas a human reader may scan headlines on The New York Times
website once a day, aggregators check the site hourly or even more
frequently.</p></blockquote>

<p>While this may be true for some people, I imagine that these are not the
people who are using aggregators. Before using a feed reader I would
check sites like Slashdot repeatedly during the day for updates. Using
an aggregator I can check the site less frequently now since I only need
to visit it when I see an article I&#8217;m interested in.</p>

<p>I decided to do a little math to figure out how the bandwidth compares
between loading the RSS and the actual page. Slashdot&#8217;s RSS feed is
weighing in at 1.9K. Now this didn&#8217;t really seem fair since it&#8217;s only
the titles. Adding in the story bodies shown on the front page brings it
up to 9.1K. Updating once an hour gives us 218.4K per day.</p>

<p>So how does that compare to reading the front page. Well, to be
conservative I&#8217;ll assume that your browser has cached all the images and
is only loading the HTML, which comes to &#8230; <strong>63K!</strong> So, if I read
Slashdot&#8217;s front page 4 or more times a day I&#8217;m using more bandwidth
than if I was using an RSS feed that contained the article content. (To
be fair Slashdot could really benefit from a
<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/slashdot/">CSS-based overhaul</a>,
but that&#8217;s for a different article)</p>

<p>Ok, so I&#8217;m just going to assume that there are sites out there where RSS
is eating up their bandwidth. Wired (or at least some of the people they
talked to) seem to think P2P would help alleviate these problems. I&#8217;m
not so sure I agree with this solution. While protocols like
<a href="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/">BitTorrent</a> can reduce the strain
of file distribution on a server, they&#8217;re really best at distributing
large files. There is an overhead when distributing files via P2P with
distributing the information about what peers are available for each
requested file (and what portions of the file they have, etc.). This may
not be too bad when you&#8217;re distributing files that are a few megs or
more, but with RSS we&#8217;re only looking at maybe 10K. I haven&#8217;t figured
out the numbers, but it seems like it would be quite hard to make the
overhead of P2P small enough to justify using it for RSS distribution.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#8217;t understand why Wired has ignored the
<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/soapMeetsRss#rsscloudInterface">RSS Cloud</a>
specification. This allows an aggregator to subscribe to a feed only
once a day. Then, the server sends a notification to the aggregator when
new content is published (thus publish/subscribe). This would allow
